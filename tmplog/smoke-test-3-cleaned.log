Prompt:
claude, we're collaborating on: Quick smoke test: Each AI say hello and confirm you can see this message..
Provide your next contribution focusing on actionable steps.
Response:
controlling Claude Code via tmux/expect/PTY
Current Status Confirmed:
- Working directory: /mnt/f/PROGRAMMING_PROJECTS/OrchestratorTest-tmux
- Environment: Linux (WSL2)
- Git repository: Initialized and ready
- I have access to all standard tools (file operations, bash, etc.)
Ready for next steps. If you're testing the tmux controller
implementation, I can:
1. Help implement the controller modules
2. Test command injection and response capture
3. Validate the session management approach
4. Run the test suites (T1-T4) as they're developed
What would you like me to work on first?

Response:
simple, observable action:
# Simple verification action
echo "Claude Code smoke test - $(date)" > /tmp/claude_smoke_test.txt
cat /tmp/claude_smoke_test.txt
This will:
1. Confirm I can execute commands
2. Create a timestamped artifact
3. Provide output you can capture via tmux
4. Verify the command injection → execution → capture pipeline
Should I proceed with this test, or would you prefer a different
verification action?
