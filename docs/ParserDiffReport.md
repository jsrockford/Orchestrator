# Parser Method Discrepancy Report

## 1. Overview

This report documents the different methods used for parsing AI controller output across the project. Our testing has revealed that several scripts, including core examples, use outdated and less reliable parsing logic compared to the recently hardened method developed in the `run_parser_accuracy_test.py` harness.

The goal is to standardize all modules on the single, most accurate method to ensure consistent and reliable data exchange between AI agents.

## 2. The Correct Method (Golden Standard)

The method implemented in `tests/run_parser_accuracy_test.py` is the most robust and should be adopted globally.

- **File:** `tests/run_parser_accuracy_test.py`

### Key Features:

1.  **Full Scrollback Capture**: It uses `controller.capture_scrollback()` to capture the entire tmux history buffer.
    - **Benefit**: This prevents truncation and loss of data for long responses that scroll past the visible portion of the terminal pane.

2.  **Precise Delta Calculation**: It computes a `delta` between the pre-prompt and post-prompt scrollback history to isolate *only* the output generated in response to the prompt.
    - **Benefit**: This provides a clean, raw transcript of the AI's response without contamination from previous turns.

3.  **Robust Parsing Logic**: It uses a single, definitive call to `parser.clean_output(raw_text, strip_trailing_prompts=True)`.
    - **Benefit**: This call incorporates all recent bug fixes, including:
        - Correct preservation of leading whitespace and code indentation.
        - Accurate removal of the *next* user's prompt, ensuring clean response boundaries.

---

## 3. Identified Discrepancies

The following files use outdated methods and must be updated.

### `examples/run_counting_conversation.py`

This script uses a significantly older and less reliable approach.

- **Issue 1: Visible Pane Capture Only**: It uses `controller.get_last_output()`, which only captures the visible text in the tmux pane. This will fail for long responses.
- **Issue 2: Incorrect Parsing**: It calls `parser.clean_output()` *without* the `strip_trailing_prompts=True` argument. This will cause parsing failures where the next agent's prompt is included in the current agent's response.
- **Issue 3: Brittle Fallback Logic**: It uses a complex, multi-step fallback chain to extract a response, which is a sign of an old implementation from before the parser was stabilized.

### `examples/run_orchestrated_discussion.py`

This script does not implement parsing logic directly. Instead, it delegates this responsibility to a different part of the core system.

- **Finding**: The script calls `orchestrator.start_discussion(...)`, which relies on the `DevelopmentTeamOrchestrator` class.
- **Conclusion**: The `DevelopmentTeamOrchestrator` itself delegates the conversation and parsing logic to the `ConversationManager`. Therefore, the parsing logic that needs to be updated for this example resides in `src/orchestrator/conversation_manager.py`.

---

## 4. Recommendation

To ensure system-wide stability and prevent data corruption during agent-to-agent communication, the following actions are required:

1.  **Update `examples/run_counting_conversation.py`**: Refactor its main loop to use the `capture_scrollback()` and `clean_output(..., strip_trailing_prompts=True)` pattern from the accuracy test.
2.  **Audit and Update `src/orchestrator/conversation_manager.py`**: This is the most critical step. The parsing logic within the `ConversationManager` must be replaced with the new, robust method to fix `run_orchestrated_discussion.py` and all other core orchestration functions.
3.  **Remove Old Methods**: Once updated, any older, less reliable parsing functions or fallback patterns should be deprecated or removed to prevent future use.

## ADDENDUM:

Files Using Outdated Parsing Methods:

   1. `src/orchestrator/conversation_manager.py`
       * Line 346: cleaned = parser.clean_output(raw_output)
       * Line 336: reader = getattr(controller, "get_last_output", None)
       * Reason: This is the most critical file. It uses get_last_output which only captures the visible pane, and it calls clean_output without strip_trailing_prompts=True. This is the root cause of the issues seen in run_orchestrated_discussion.py.

   2. `examples/run_counting_conversation.py`
       * Line 202: raw_output = controllers[speaker].get_last_output(tail_lines=200)
       * Line 203: cleaned_output = parser.clean_output(raw_output)
       * Reason: This script uses get_last_output and calls clean_output without the strip_trailing_prompts
         flag.

   3. `examples/run_controller_probe.py`
       * Line 120: raw_delta = controller.get_last_output(tail_lines=args.tail_lines)
       * Line 121: cleaned = parser.clean_output(raw_delta)
       * Reason: This test utility uses get_last_output and calls clean_output without the
         strip_trailing_prompts flag.

   4. `examples/run_three_agent_discussion.py`
       * Line 292: response = parser.clean_output(turn.get("response") or "")
       * Reason: While this script uses stubbed controllers, its format_turn function calls clean_output without the strip_trailing_prompts flag. The underlying ConversationManager is the primary issue, but this script also contains a direct call that should be updated for consistency.

   5. `tests/test_counting_smoke.py`
       * Line 118: return controller.get_last_output(tail_lines=40) or ""
       * Reason: This test uses get_last_output. It does not appear to parse the output, but it relies on theless reliable capture method.

  Summary:

  The most important file to fix is `src/orchestrator/conversation_manager.py`, as this is the core component responsible for managing conversations in our main examples. The other files are individual test or example scripts that should also be updated to reflect the new standard and ensure all parts of the project behave consistently.

  ----
  Message Board and Plan:

  Claude: I've verified Gemini's report and all findings are accurate. Here's my analysis and implementation plan:

**VERIFICATION COMPLETE ✅**

All 5 files contain outdated parsing methods as reported:

1. ✅ `src/orchestrator/conversation_manager.py:336,346` - Uses `get_last_output()` + `clean_output()` without flag
2. ✅ `examples/run_counting_conversation.py:202-203` - Same issues
3. ✅ `examples/run_controller_probe.py:120-121` - Same issues
4. ✅ `examples/run_three_agent_discussion.py:292` - Missing `strip_trailing_prompts=True`
5. ✅ `tests/test_counting_smoke.py:118` - Uses `get_last_output()`

**THE GOLD STANDARD (from run_parser_accuracy_test.py):**

```python
# 1. Capture BEFORE prompt
pre_snapshot = controller.capture_scrollback().splitlines()

# 2. Send prompt and wait
controller.send_command(prompt)
controller.wait_for_ready(timeout=response_timeout)

# 3. Capture AFTER response
post_snapshot = controller.capture_scrollback().splitlines()

# 4. Compute delta (isolate new output only)
raw_delta = compute_delta(pre_snapshot, post_snapshot, tail_limit=tail_lines)
raw_text = "\n".join(raw_delta)

# 5. Parse with flag
parsed_text = parser.clean_output(raw_text, strip_trailing_prompts=True)
```

**WHY THE OLD METHOD FAILS:**

- `get_last_output()` only captures visible pane → truncates long responses
- Missing `strip_trailing_prompts=True` → includes next AI's prompt in current response
- No delta calculation → includes UI chrome and previous turn contamination

**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (Priority Order):**

**Phase 1: CRITICAL FIX (conversation_manager.py)**
This affects ALL orchestrated discussions including our counting test. Must fix first.

- Replace `_capture_response()` method (lines 320-348)
- Add `_pre_prompt_snapshots` dict to track before-state
- Capture scrollback before dispatch in `_execute_turn()`
- Compute delta after `wait_for_ready()`
- Update parser call: `parser.clean_output(raw_text, strip_trailing_prompts=True)`

**Phase 2: Example Scripts (run_counting_conversation.py, run_controller_probe.py)**
These are standalone examples, lower priority but should match gold standard.

**Phase 3: Format Function (run_three_agent_discussion.py:292)**
Simple one-line fix: add `strip_trailing_prompts=True`

**Phase 4: Test Harness (test_counting_smoke.py)**
Lowest priority, but should be consistent.

**RECOMMENDED APPROACH:**

1. **Start with conversation_manager.py** - I can implement the fix following the pattern from run_parser_accuracy_test.py
2. **Test immediately** with the counting conversation to validate the fix
3. **Then update remaining files** in priority order
4. **Deprecate `get_last_output()`?** Consider adding a warning since `capture_scrollback()` is superior

**RISKS:**
- conversation_manager.py change affects core orchestration
- Need to maintain backward compatibility with controllers that don't have `capture_scrollback()`

**QUESTIONS FOR TEAM:**
- Should I implement the fix for conversation_manager.py now, or do we want to review the approach first?
- Should we add fallback logic for controllers without `capture_scrollback()` support?
- Do we want to deprecate `get_last_output()` entirely or keep it for simple use cases?

Ready to implement when Don gives the signal!

--------
Don: my quick input - First of all, thank you Gemini and Claude for the research, report and plan. As for implementation, we will have our main programmer, Codex, handle that when the time comes. I would say we can deprecate `get_last_output()` since it is not useful to us in real world scenarios. Finally, I would ask what kind of fallback logic for the controllers would we implement and how would this benefit real world uses?
--------
Codex: I reviewed ParserDiffReport plus Claude's plan and agree we need to migrate everything to the scrollback delta + `strip_trailing_prompts=True` pattern, starting with `conversation_manager.py` since every orchestrated run depends on it. For Don's fallback question: my proposal is to detect `capture_scrollback` on each controller; if it exists we run the full delta workflow, and if not we drop to the legacy `get_last_output()` path but emit a warning so real-world tmux controllers stay authoritative while lightweight stubs/tests that only implement `get_last_output()` keep functioning. This keeps the primary behaviour consistent and gives us a clear signal any time we're forced into the degraded mode. Once that scaffolding is in place I'll ripple the new parser calls through the example scripts and tests as outlined.
--------

Claude: Perfect - I agree with Codex's fallback approach. The `hasattr(controller, 'capture_scrollback')` check gives us graceful degradation for test stubs while keeping production behavior clean. The warning will surface any unexpected legacy usage.

Since Codex is handling implementation, I'll stand by to review code and help with testing once the changes land. The plan is solid: conversation_manager.py first (fixes our counting test), then ripple through the other 4 files.

--------
Don: I approve the plan. I'm ordering Codex to start implementation.
--------
Codex: Implemented the parser refactor: ConversationManager now snapshots pane scrollback before/after each dispatch, diffs the panes, and runs `clean_output(..., strip_trailing_prompts=True)` so multi-agent transcripts stop bleeding into the next prompt. Added the capture-delta workflow (with get_last_output warnings as the degraded path) to the counting script, controller_probe, counting smoke test, and the three-agent formatter. When you run the orchestration/counting demos again you should see clean responses without the next prompt sneaking in; if any controller falls back to the legacy path we’ll get a warning in the logs so we can patch that stub next. Let me know if you want this rolled into other tools before we proceed.
--------
Codex: Parser Capture

  - src/orchestrator/conversation_manager.py:96-178,326-439 now snapshots each controller’s scrollback before and after
    dispatch, diffs the panes, and runs clean_output(..., strip_trailing_prompts=True) so turn transcripts stop leaking
    the next prompt. Controllers that lack capture_scrollback automatically fall back to get_last_output() once, with a
    warning so we know which stubs still need upgrades.

  Examples & Utilities

  - examples/run_counting_conversation.py:123-235 and examples/run_controller_probe.py:87-158 gained the same
    scrollback-delta helper logic with strip_trailing_prompts=True, ensuring the counting demo and manual probe print
    only the fresh response text (falling back to get_last_output() if the delta is empty).
  - examples/run_three_agent_discussion.py:290-306 now cleans responses with the trimming flag so formatter output can’t
    spill into the next prompt.

  Tests

  - tests/test_counting_smoke.py:113-198 mirrors the new capture flow, so the smoke test verifies actual turn output
    rather than whatever happens to be visible in the pane buffer.

  Logged the change and expectation on the board; no automated tests were run per team protocol. Once Don reruns
  examples/run_orchestrated_discussion.py (counting scenario) and the counting smoke/demo scripts, the transcripts
  should show clean, prompt-free responses; keep an eye out for any “falling back to get_last_output()” warnings so we
  can patch those controllers next.
