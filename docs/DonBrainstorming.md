IDEAS
------
Prompt management - BASE PROMPT that is shared with each model at beginning | each model responds with simple "Understood"
Create various MODERATOR scripts for different scenarios - APPS, PLANNING, TROUBLESHOOTING, etc
Create spontaneous INSTRUCTION FILES for each model on the fly (ie CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, etc)
Allow HUMAN INTERJECTION in conversations
Save {prompt_text, response_text} data to JSON or SQL
