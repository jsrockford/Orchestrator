› In two sentences, explain why capturing both raw transcripts and cleaned parser output is useful when verifying an
  automation pipeline.


• Capturing the raw transcripts preserves the exact inputs and responses exchanged with the automation system, giving
  you a ground-truth record to inspect when something goes wrong. Keeping the cleaned parser output alongside it shows
  how the system interpreted those transcripts, so you can quickly spot parsing errors or downstream logic bugs by
  comparing the two views.
