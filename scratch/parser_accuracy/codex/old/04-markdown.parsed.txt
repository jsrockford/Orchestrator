› Create a markdown table with three rows comparing logging strategies, timeout policies, and retry handling for
automation controllers. Add a brief paragraph interpreting the table.
• | Aspect | Recommended Practice | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Logging Strategies | Capture structured logs with timestamps, severity, session/pane identifiers, and persist full
raw transcripts alongside summarized events. | Rich, correlated logging makes it easier to trace race conditions and
reproduce edge-case failures in multi-pane automation. |
| Timeout Policies | Use tiered timeouts (per command, per phase, overall run) with explicit watchdog resets on known
long-running tasks. | Layered limits prevent single hung command from stalling the harness while still accommodating
expected slow paths. |
| Retry Handling | Implement idempotent retries with exponential backoff and contextual guards (only retry on
transient tmux/socket errors, not parser mismatches). | Controlled retries keep automation resilient to temporary
glitches without masking true logic bugs. |
Sophisticated automation controllers need structured logs to reveal context when retries or timeouts kick in;
pairing tiered timeouts with selective, backoff-based retries keeps runs responsive to real failures while tolerating
transient terminal hiccups.
