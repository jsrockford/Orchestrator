› In two sentences, explain why capturing both raw transcripts and cleaned parser output is useful when verifying an
  automation pipeline.


• Capturing raw transcripts preserves the ground truth from the original interaction so you can trace errors back
  to their source and spot issues the parser might hide. Having the cleaned parser output alongside it confirms that
  each transformation step behaved as expected and lets you compare automated decisions against the unaltered data to
  validate the pipeline end to end.
