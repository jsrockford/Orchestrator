      "response": "Capturing raw transcripts provides the exact, unaltered input to the parser, which is crucial for debugging parsing logic and identifying the root cause of any errors. The cleaned parser output, on\nthe other hand, represents the final, structured data that downstream systems will consume, making it essential for verifying the accuracy and correctness of the data extraction process itself."
