> Create a markdown table with three rows comparing logging strategies,
timeout policies, and retry handling for automation controllers. Add a brief
paragraph interpreting the table.
● | Aspect | Conservative Approach | Balanced Approach | Aggressive Approach
|
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------
|
| **Logging Strategy** | Log every capture attempt, raw buffers, and
timing data to separate files per session; retain indefinitely | Log
commands sent, parsed responses, and errors to rotating daily logs; keep 7
days | Log only failures and warnings; disable debug output in production
|
| **Timeout Policies** | Startup: 30s, Command: 120s, Capture poll: 2s
intervals; fail-fast on first timeout | Startup: 10s, Command: 30s,
Capture poll: 0.5s intervals; retry once with exponential backoff |
Startup: 5s, Command: 10s, Capture poll: 0.1s intervals; no retries,
immediate failure |
| **Retry Handling** | Retry all failed operations 5 times with 2x backoff
(max 60s wait); persist retry state to disk | Retry transient failures
(I/O, network) 3 times with 1.5x backoff; skip retries for logic errors |
No automatic retries; bubble exceptions immediately to caller for manual
intervention |
Interpretation
The table illustrates three philosophies for automation controller design
with inherent tradeoffs. The conservative approach maximizes debuggability
and resilience but incurs storage overhead and slower failure detection
(potentially masking systemic issues through excessive retries). The
balanced approach represents production-ready defaults that handle
transient failures gracefully while maintaining visibility into system
health through selective logging. The aggressive approach prioritizes
speed and minimal overhead, making it suitable for high-frequency testing
or scenarios where fast failure feedback is more valuable than automatic
recovery—however, it requires robust external monitoring since internal
diagnostics are minimal. Most tmux-based automation harnesses benefit from
the balanced approach initially, shifting toward conservative logging
during development/debugging phases and potentially adopting aggressive
policies only after stability is proven.
