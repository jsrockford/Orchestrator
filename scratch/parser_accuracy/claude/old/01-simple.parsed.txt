> In two sentences, explain why capturing both raw transcripts and cleaned
parser output is useful when verifying an automation pipeline.
‚óè Raw transcripts preserve the complete, unmodified output including escape
sequences and control characters, allowing you to debug parser failures
and verify what was actually received from the controlled process. Cleaned
parser output shows what your application logic sees and uses, enabling
you to validate both the parsing correctness and the end-to-end pipeline
behavior by comparing the two.
