Interpretation
The table reveals a fundamental trade-off between robustness and
responsiveness in automation controller design. The conservative approach
prioritizes debuggability and fault toleranceâ€”ideal for initial POC
development and production deployments where understanding failures is
critical, though at the cost of storage and latency. The balanced approach
offers practical middle ground suitable for most automation scenarios,
providing adequate observability while maintaining reasonable performance.
The aggressive approach optimizes for speed and resource efficiency but
sacrifices diagnostic capability, making it appropriate only for
high-volume, well-tested scenarios where failures are rare and rapid
recovery matters more than understanding root causes. For the Claude Code
interaction POC, starting conservative during development then migrating
toward balanced for production use would provide the best learning path
while building confidence in the system's reliability.
