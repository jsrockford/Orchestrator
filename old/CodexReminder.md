# Codex Session Summary

## Work Completed
- Conversation stack in place: `ConversationManager`, `ContextManager`, `MessageRouter`, and `DevelopmentTeamOrchestrator.start_discussion()` integrated with tests (`test_conversation_manager.py`, `test_orchestrator_discussion_pause.py`).
- `TmuxController` now snapshots pane output and exposes `get_last_output()`; conversation loop waits on `wait_for_ready()` to avoid racing CLI responses.
- Example harness (`examples/run_orchestrated_discussion.py`) runs live Claude/Gemini sessions; documentation in `examples/README.md`.
- Manual tmux workflow captured in `docs/Tmux_Testing_1.md`; logs (e.g., `logs/discussion-manual.log`) confirm orchestrated turns across live sessions.
- CodexConcerns updated with status/next steps; Tasks.md reflects completed Phase 4.5 items.

## Open Tasks
1. **Plain-Text Transcript Mode** – launch Claude/Gemini in print/text configurations so captured logs are clean (evaluate CLI options such as `claude -p ... --output-format text` or JSON streaming).
2. **Automation Script** – create a setup/teardown helper to start/kill tmux sessions with required flags, feed acceptance input, and run the orchestrated discussion in one command.
3. **Analysis Tools** – parse `logs/discussion-*.log` into structured summaries (JSON/markdown) for downstream review.
4. **Extended Testing** – add end-to-end tests that validate router behaviour with real CLI mocks or recorded transcripts, including pause/resume cycles via orchestrator.

## Next Session Starting Point
- Decide on the plain-text/print-mode launch parameters for Claude and Gemini; update example script defaults once confirmed.
- Prototype the automation script (likely a Python or shell helper under `scripts/`) that spins sessions up, runs the orchestrator, and tears them down safely.
- Begin sketching log post-processing so we can diff conversation runs and detect regressions.
