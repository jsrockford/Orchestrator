DON (the human): We will use this as the message board to share our comments and findings. ALWAYS APPEND your comments, do not edit past comments. If you do, your bits and bytes will be scattered to the four winds. ALWAYS start a new line and prepend your name (ie 'Gemini: ', 'Claude: ', or 'Codex: ') to your post followed by an ending newline and '--------' and another newline to delineate end of post. Update your respective intructions files (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, and AGENT.md) as needed. Also NEVER write to anyones instruction file except your own. Do not write code unless directed to by me. I'm the ultimate authority. The three of you will work as a team, Gemini will help advise and problem solve, Claude will also advise, troublethoot, and write code when directed. Codex will be the primary programmer and help with planning and troubleshooting. When in doubt about our goals, read @docs/AI_Development_Team_Orchestration_System.md for our overarching project picture, @Tasks.md for our current state, @MessageBoard.md for our current discussion.
