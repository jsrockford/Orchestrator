  - Gemini config loading correctly (`C-m` submit, 0.5s delays)

**Remaining** (Deferred to future work):
- [ ] Test 4: File operations with Gemini
- [ ] Test 5: Rapid sequential commands (both AIs)
- [ ] Test 6: Error scenarios with recovery (both AIs)

**Key Fixes Applied**:
- Fixed command truncation ("only 'I' was input") via observation-based startup detection
- Increased startup timeouts to 20s for real-world variability
- Changed Gemini test prompts to avoid triggering file edit permissions
- Implemented output stabilization for response completion detection
- **October 20, 2025**: Fixed case-sensitivity in config loading (`name.lower()`) in orchestration script
  - Root cause: `get_config().get_section(name)` with capitalized names ("Claude"/"Gemini") didn't match lowercase config sections
  - Solution: Changed to `get_config().get_section(name.lower())` and `if name.lower() == "gemini"`
  - Result: Config now loads correctly, Gemini receives full prompts, smoke test passes

## Key Findings to Document

### Claude Code Behavior ✅
- **Prompt Pattern**: `>` appears immediately, even while thinking
- **Startup Time**: ~8 seconds (3s for trust, 3s for initialization)
- **Response Indicators**: Output stabilization detection (wait_for_ready)
- **Output Format**: Text with unicode box drawing, ANSI codes present
- **Response Marker**: `●` (filled circle)
- **Critical**: Text and Enter must be separate tmux send-keys commands

### Gemini CLI Behavior ✅
- **Prompt Pattern**: `>` inside box format `│ > Question │`
- **Startup Time**: ~3 seconds (no trust confirmation needed)
- **Response Indicators**: Output stabilization works same as Claude
- **Output Format**: Boxed questions (╭╰│), cleaner UI
- **Response Marker**: `✦` (sparkle/star symbol)
- **Tool Support**: Has tool execution capability with `✓` marker
- **Differences from Claude**: Faster startup, different UI, supports tools

### Timing Baselines (measured) ✅
- Session startup: ~8 seconds
- Simple command response: 2-5 seconds (varies by complexity)
- Complex command response: 5-10+ seconds
- Buffer stabilization time: 1.5 seconds (3 checks @ 0.5s each)

### Critical Discoveries ✅
- [x] Can we detect "thinking" vs "ready" state? **YES** - Output stabilization works
- [x] Is there output when commands complete? **YES** - Returns to prompt with separators
- [x] How does Claude Code handle rapid commands? **ISSUE FOUND & FIXED** - Commands sent too fast overlap on same line; wait_for_ready() solves this
- [x] What indicates an error vs normal response? **TBD** - Need more testing with errors

## Phase 6: Multi-Agent Foundation & Production Hardening

**Objective**: Extend orchestration to support N agents (add Codex via agent invocation), then validate system reliability through comprehensive stress testing and error recovery scenarios.

**Timeline**: 2 weeks (Week 1: Integration, Week 2: Hardening)

### Phase 6.1: Response Completion Detection Fix ✅ COMPLETE

**Objective**: Fix premature turn-passing bug where orchestrator switched control before AI responses were complete.

**Root Cause Identified**: `_is_response_ready()` was checking for completion markers anywhere in the buffer instead of only at the end, causing false positives from command echoes.

**Implementation Date**: October 23, 2025

#### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Create debug logging infrastructure (`debug_wait_logging` config flag)

  - [x] Validate with 3 successful test runs
- [x] Fix Gemini completion detection
  - [x] Verify stability-based fallback works (no loading indicator)
  - [x] Validate with 3 successful test runs
- [x] Fix Codex completion detection

  - [x] Keep "Worked for" as fallback marker (not required)
  - [x] Increase tail window to 26 lines
  - [x] Validate with 3 successful test runs
